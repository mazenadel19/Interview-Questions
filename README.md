# Cassidy Williams Weekly Newsletter Interview Questions

Welcome to the repository for solving Cassidy Williams' weekly interview questions from her [newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/)! This repository will be used to document and share my solutions to her interesting coding challenges.

Challenges are organized by year and date, with each stored in a directory named after the issue date. For example, a challenge titled 'Determine the longest unique number' from April 15, 2024, would be in the 2024/2024-04-15 directory.
