# Cassidy Williams Weekly Newsletter Interview Questions

Welcome to the repository for solving Cassidy Williams' weekly interview questions from her [newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/)! This repository will be used to document and share my solutions to her interesting coding challenges.

## Structure

Each coding challenge will be stored in a separate file, with the file name representing the question title and the date. For example, if there's a challenge titled "Determine the longest unique number" from April 15, 2024, the file name would be 15-04-2024_determine_the_longest_unique.
